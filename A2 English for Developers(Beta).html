                    <li>Contractions are commonly used to make speech sound more natural and fluent. <span class="mark">You're</span> is a contraction of <span class="mark">you are</span>.<br>
                        <span class="mark">Are</span> is used here in the <span class="wordred">present affirmative</span> to <span class="wordred">make a statement</span> or ask a question.<br>
                        This is a typical way to confirm someone's <span class="wordred">role</span> or <span class="wordred">identity</span> in English.<br>
                        Contractions are a way to shorten common combinations of words, especially with verbs.</li>
                    <li>To check or confirm something people sometimes use tag questions. For example, <span class="mark">You're a programmer, right?</span><br>
